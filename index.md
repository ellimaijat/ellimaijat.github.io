## Introduction

I am a third year French major at the university of Helsinki. As a 
minor, I have studied communications. My aim is to combine my studies in 
French and communications around social media use in French-speaking 
countries.
My interests also include international development and cooperation. I 
am currently very interested in the work of intergovernmental 
organizations and the way they interact with governments and civil 
society.
